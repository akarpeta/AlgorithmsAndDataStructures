# AlgorithmsAndDataStructures
Implementation of the Kruskal algorithm.
Project goals:
1. Network modeling
Implementation of classes and structures representing the link node and path.
2. Data loading
Program reads information about the network from .txt file (location of nodes and link values) 
3. Graph algorithm
Program has implemented spanning tree algorithm (KRUSKAL)
4. Displaying the results
The application draws the loaded network. The result of the algorithm is marked with green.
